# hk_anis
Take seismic receiver functions and make HK stacks, while accounting for radial anisotropy. This package accompanies the paper XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Please feel free to contact me (brennanbrunsvik@ucsb.edu) if you need any help or would like my collaboration. We would be very happy if somebody wanted to convert all of this to Python, or a fast compiled language. 
 
hk_figs_station_paper.m shows an examples of making anisotropic HK stacks for a particular station. It makes some figures used in the paper. 

hk_error_paper.m makes some figures that show, analytically, how much error can be induced from ignoring anisotropy.
